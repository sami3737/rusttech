										<p>RustTech is a server built on solid foundations and hours of Rust experience. RustTech has a range of plugins including Homes, TP's, and Kits, as well as high gather rates to encourage a more action rather than grinding hours on end. Also plugins such as AutoAuthorization to enhance your experience by making it quicker to add friends to toolcupboards and SuperLoot increases the chances of finding higher tier items to decrease the grinding aspect of rust.

									<h2>Terms & Condtions</h2>
									<p>By donating anything for any of our servers. You are agreeing to our terms and conditions.<br /> Please be sure to read them.</p>
									<p class="content2" style="font-size: 1em"><b>This Agreement was last modified on November 12, 2016.</b> Please read these Terms of Service (hereafter known as "Agreement" and "Terms of Service") carefully before using  rusttech.net (hereafter known as "the Site") operated by RustTech Gaming (hereafter known as "us", "we", and "our"). This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the Site. By accessing or using the Site or any other of our services in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content or other materials to the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Capitalised terms are defined in this Agreement.
<br>
<b>Refund Policy:</b> All sales/donations associated with RustTech Gaming are final and there are no refunds available, NO EXCEPTIONS! If your son or daughter took your card without your consent, that is not our fault. We can not monitor what your children do, nor should we. That falls on the parent and we will not lose money because of it. Any chargebacks against RTG will have you banned from our servers and we will dispute them in our favour. Legal action will be taken if we feel it is necessary. Donations are donations to help the server prosper. Any in game items you receive after donating are complimentary from the staff here a RustTech Gaming. We may transfer over ranks to a new user as long as both accounts have the same owner. If values of items are tampered within the store, no refund and no products that were purchased  will be given, and you will be terminated access of this site and off all of our servers. We have the right to change pricing, quantity and what is in each rank or kit at any given time. Being banned off the server does not give you the right to charge back a donation, as hacking and cheating is taken seriously thus purchasing anything does not make you resistant to being banned.

<b>Links To Other Sites:</b> Our Site may contain links to third-party sites that are not owned or controlled by RustTech Gaming.

<b>Changes To This Agreement:</b> We reserve the right to, at our sole discretion, modify or replace these Terms of Service by posting the updated terms on the Site. Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. Please review this Agreement periodically for changes.
